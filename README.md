# Description
Yes, this is the legendary calamari. The same cheat from RSHOE's videos. Now this is a non-working piece of code that only runs on versions 512-513. At the moment, most servers only work stably on 514, so there are few places you can test it. (lifeweb and some other servers that have not yet enabled client version checking)


# Installation Instruction #1:
I don't know if this will work
how to compile:
 use c-make
 make sure it's Win32 / x86
 compile as release
 copy calamari.dll and wsock32.dll next to dreamseeker
 copy the plugins into [Documents/BYOND/Calamari/Plugins]
 have fun

# Installation Instruction #2:
 A castrated version of calamari that will definitely work.
 
 SERAPH 1.0

HOW TO INSTALL:
 1. Drag «bin/wsock32.dll» and «bin/seraph.dll» into your BYOND/bin folder. This is usually «C:\Program Files (x86)\BYOND\bin».
 2. Drag the «Seraph» folder into «My Documents/BYOND». It should be next to "key.txt" and "cache".
 3. Launch BYOND! A configuration file will be auto-generated, allowing you to change your CID, keybinds, etc.

Should work for all BYOND 513 versions, and 512 too, in both native Windows and Wine/Proton.
	NOTE: if you're using Wine, disable D9VK/DXVK! It breaks BYOND!

Plugin source in «src» folder.
Plugin SDK in «sdk» folder.


# Conclusion:
Better use ByondControl instead of this non-working piece of code.
